widget displaying sorted Amazon wishlist
== Description ==
This Widget displays your amazon wishlist sorted whichever way you want, most interestingly by **priority**, where other wishlist plugins do not allow you to do that. That's why I had to write this!

It works fine for me, but let me know if you find any bugs.

== Installation ==


1. Upload the amazon-wishlist folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the "widgets" page, under "Appearance"
4. Add the Amazon-wishlist widget to your sidebar
5. Fill in all required options.
6. There you go, the first X items from your sorted wishlist should appear on your blog.
